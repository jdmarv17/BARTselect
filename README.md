This is a repository to store the function files to replicate results in the paper "Detecting Interactions Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees." Data used for analyses comes from two R packages. The birth weight data comes from MASS::birthwt and the medical expenditures data comes from Ecdat::MedExp. Both packages are readily available for installation from CRAN.
